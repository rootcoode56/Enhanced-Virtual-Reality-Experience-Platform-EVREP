Virtual Reality Database Management System Project
I created this project for my academic purpose. The main goal of this project is to secure a database system for all the Virtual Reality users. Also this system collects all the data of:
1. User data.
2. Manage user interaction.
3. Collect User Feedback.
4. Recommend user according to their preferences.
5. Personalize system info
6. Track user interaction data
7. Real-time data analytics
8. Tutorial Info
9. User device compatibility.
10. Manage user security.

I used MySQL language here and added some project-related screenshots inside "Project Screenshots".
